Including videos in a webpage can cause lot of trouble while making it compatible for all browsers and devices. One of such situation is autoplaying video when the mobile device is on low power mode or data saving mode. Low power mode, as the name suggests, it saves the battery of the device as much as it can by various means. One of them is by disabling autoplay of media items such as videos but the MAJOR problem is that the play button stays in place and is not hidden.

This plugin is for Elementor but can be adapted for other builders.

This plugins Hides the video container if low power mode is detected

Simply add a classname to your section/columns (see below):

.background-video-fix

On devices with low battery (it hides the button and all) but the moment you click/touch your device it starts playing ^_^
